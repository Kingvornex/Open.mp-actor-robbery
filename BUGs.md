After reviewing the code in the repository, I've identified several bugs and potential issues. Here's a summary of the critical bugs found:

### 1. **Actor Slot Reuse After Destruction**
**Location:** `DestroyActorEx` function  
**Issue:** When an actor is destroyed, the slot is immediately marked as available for reuse without proper cleanup of robbery-related states.  
**Problem:** If a robbery was in progress when the actor was destroyed, residual data (`actorRobbery`, `robberId`, `robberyTime`) remains in the slot. When a new actor is created in the same slot, it might inherit stale robbery states, causing undefined behavior.  
**Fix:** Explicitly reset all robbery-related fields in `DestroyActorEx`:
```pawn
DestroyActorEx(actorid) {
    if (!ActorData[actorid][actorCreated]) return 0;
    DestroyActor(ActorData[actorid][actorId]);
    ActorData[actorid][actorCreated] = false;
    ActorData[actorid][actorId] = INVALID_ACTOR_ID;
    ActorData[actorid][actorHealth] = 0.0;
    ActorData[actorid][actorSkin] = 0;
    ActorData[actorid][actorPos][0] = 0.0;
    ActorData[actorid][actorPos][1] = 0.0;
    ActorData[actorid][actorPos][2] = 0.0;
    ActorData[actorid][actorPos][3] = 0.0;
    // Reset robbery states
    ActorData[actorid][actorRobbery] = false;
    ActorData[actorid][robberyTime] = 0;
    ActorData[actorid][robberId] = INVALID_PLAYER_ID;
    return 1;
}
```

### 2. **Robbery Completion on Invalid Player**
**Location:** `OnPlayerUpdate` callback  
**Issue:** The robbery completion logic doesn't verify if the robber (`robberId`) is still connected.  
**Problem:** If a player disconnects mid-robbery, the actor remains stuck in a robbery state indefinitely. The timer check in `OnPlayerUpdate` continues to run for the disconnected player, wasting resources and potentially causing errors.  
**Fix:** Add a player connection check before processing robbery completion:
```pawn
public OnPlayerUpdate(playerid) {
    for (new i = 0; i < MAX_ACTORS; i++) {
        if (ActorData[i][actorCreated] && ActorData[i][actorRobbery]) {
            new robberId = ActorData[i][robberId];
            // Check if robber is still connected
            if (!IsPlayerConnected(robberId)) {
                ActorData[i][actorRobbery] = false;
                ActorData[i][robberId] = INVALID_PLAYER_ID;
                continue;
            }
            // Existing timer logic...
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

### 3. **Tick Count Overflow in Robbery Timer**
**Location:** `OnPlayerUpdate` callback  
**Issue:** The robbery timer uses `GetTickCount()` without handling overflow.  
**Problem:** `GetTickCount()` returns a 32-bit integer that overflows after ~49 days. If the server runs long enough, the elapsed time calculation (`GetTickCount() - robberyTime`) becomes negative, preventing robbery completion.  
**Fix:** Use unsigned arithmetic to handle overflow:
```pawn
public OnPlayerUpdate(playerid) {
    for (new i = 0; i < MAX_ACTORS; i++) {
        if (ActorData[i][actorCreated] && ActorData[i][actorRobbery]) {
            new robberId = ActorData[i][robberId];
            if (!IsPlayerConnected(robberId)) {
                ActorData[i][actorRobbery] = false;
                ActorData[i][robberId] = INVALID_PLAYER_ID;
                continue;
            }
            // Handle tick count overflow
            new currentTime = GetTickCount();
            new elapsedTime = (currentTime - ActorData[i][robberyTime]) & 0x7FFFFFFF;
            if (elapsedTime >= MAX_ROBBERY_TIME) {
                // Robbery completion logic...
            }
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

### 4. **Concurrent Robbery Exploit**
**Location:** `StartActorRobbery` function  
**Issue:** Players can initiate multiple robberies simultaneously.  
**Problem:** A player can start robbing a new actor while already robbing another, bypassing the single-robbery restriction. This allows exploiting the system for rapid money gain.  
**Fix:** Check if the player is already robbing another actor:
```pawn
StartActorRobbery(actorid, playerid) {
    if (!ActorData[actorid][actorCreated] || ActorData[actorid][actorRobbery]) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Check if player is already robbing another actor
    for (new i = 0; i < MAX_ACTORS; i++) {
        if (i != actorid && ActorData[i][actorRobbery] && ActorData[i][robberId] == playerid) {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "You are already robbing another actor!");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    // Existing robbery start logic...
}
```

### 5. **Unvalidated Actor Creation**
**Location:** `CreateActorEx` function  
**Issue:** The function doesn't validate if `CreateActor` succeeded.  
**Problem:** If actor creation fails (e.g., invalid skin ID), the slot is marked as `created` with an invalid `actorId`. Subsequent operations (e.g., `DestroyActor`) may crash the server.  
**Fix:** Check the return value of `CreateActor`:
```pawn
CreateActorEx(skinid, Float:x, Float:y, Float:z, Float:rotation) {
    for (new i = 0; i < MAX_ACTORS; i++) {
        if (!ActorData[i][actorCreated]) {
            new actorid = CreateActor(skinid, x, y, z, rotation);
            if (actorid == INVALID_ACTOR_ID) {
                return -1; // Indicate failure
            }
            // Initialize actor data...
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### 6. **Inefficient Distance Calculation**
**Location:** `OnPlayerKeyStateChange` callback  
**Issue:** Player-actor distance is calculated using `GetPlayerDistanceFromPoint`, which is inefficient.  
**Problem:** This function recalculates the player's position internally, even though we already have it. This causes redundant calculations and performance degradation.  
**Fix:** Use direct distance calculation:
```pawn
public OnPlayerKeyStateChange(playerid, newkeys, oldkeys) {
    if (newkeys & KEY_SECONDARY_ATTACK) {
        new Float:px, Float:py, Float:pz;
        GetPlayerPos(playerid, px, py, pz);
        for (new i = 0; i < MAX_ACTORS; i++) {
            if (ActorData[i][actorCreated]) {
                new Float:distance = floatsqroot(
                    floatpower(px - ActorData[i][actorPos][0], 2.0) +
                    floatpower(py - ActorData[i][actorPos][1], 2.0) +
                    floatpower(pz - ActorData[i][actorPos][2], 2.0)
                );
                if (distance <= 3.0) {
                    // Existing robbery start/stop logic...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Add Range Validation:**  
   Validate `skinid` in `CreateActorEx` to prevent crashes from invalid skin IDs (0-299 are valid in GTA:SA).

2. **Optimize Actor Looping:**  
   Maintain a list of active actors to avoid iterating through all 100 slots in callbacks like `OnPlayerUpdate`.

3. **Add Robbery Cooldown:**  
   Implement a cooldown period after a robbery completes to prevent players from immediately re-robbery the same actor.

4. **Synchronize Actor State:**  
   Use a mutex or critical section if the server is multi-threaded to prevent race conditions during actor state updates.

These fixes address critical bugs related to memory safety, logic errors, and performance issues. Apply them to ensure the robbery system functions reliably.
